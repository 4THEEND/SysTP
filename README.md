# SysTP

This project is an implementation of the game Igel Ã„rgern made for a project in a developpement module. </br>
For the compilation the libraries SDL2 and SDL2_ttf are needed and could be installed (on debian/ubuntu) with the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev 
```

There is for the moment two differents modes : shell and graphical </br>
shell is the one enabled by default but can also be called with
```
./igel shell
```

The other mode graphical is the same game but with a GUI made with SDL2 and can be called with
```
./igel grphical
```
